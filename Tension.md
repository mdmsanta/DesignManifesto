## Design for Tension

In this design sprint we were tasked with creating a chatbot to talk to users about a tense topic. My group decided to make a bot that talked about the pros and cons of school uniforms, as this is a constantly debated topic, especially amongst those in public schools. We set it up so that if the user was pro-uniform, the bot would argue argainst uniforms, and vice versa. For this project in particular, user testing proved to be invaluable. We were able to see where the flow of conversation was not as natural or places the user may get stuck. We also created a demo video for this project, which was the first time we had done this. The video shows the main features of our bot in action.
