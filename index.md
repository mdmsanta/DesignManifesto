## About Me

I am currently a freshman CS major at WPI. While I do not know exactly what I want to do within the field itself, I do know that ultimatley I want to create programs that somehow benefit society. HCI plays a huge role in this, as it is not just knowing how to program, but knowing how to program for a user, and knowing what will benefit them most. I plan to use the techniques I learned from this class in my future projects as a way of helping me achieve my goal.

### Projects

Throughout the course of the term I worked on six different projects, all with different goals. Below are the links to the Medium posts about each project, as well as a short description of each.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mdmsanta/DesignManifesto/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
