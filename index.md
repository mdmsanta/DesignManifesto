## About Me

I am currently a freshman CS major at WPI. While I do not know exactly what I want to do within the field itself, I do know that ultimatley I want to create programs that somehow benefit society. HCI plays a huge role in this, as it is not just knowing how to program, but knowing how to program for a user, and knowing what will benefit them most. I plan to use the techniques I learned from this class in my future projects as a way of helping me achieve my goal.


### Design Manifesto

Throughout the course of the term I worked on six different projects, all with different goals. From these projects I learned a lot about the design process. To read about my experiences and thoughts on the design process, including how I refined it to my needs, read my Design Manifesto.
