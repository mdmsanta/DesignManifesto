## Design for Understanding

In this project we worked in groups to create different graphs to display the same data, but to convey different meanings. I learned that even though the data portrayed is technically the same in terms of numbers, the visualizations chosen can convey drastically different messages. We chose three graphs to represent the data so the users could understand what the data was supposed to portray in as unbiased a way as possible. Our final graph however, was used for persuasion; its purpose was to sway users towards one specific idea. Data visualizations are powerful and can be very impactful, and it is because of this that we must put a lot of thought into our choices for representing data.
