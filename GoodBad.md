## Good Design, Bad Design

This was the first project I worked on this term. The goal of this project was to find examples of good and bad design on WPI's campus. While a seemingly simple task, it made me more aware of my surroundings and made me put more thought into *why* certain things were the way they were. It put me in the mindset of really thinking about design and it taught me about the design concepts I would need to know for future projects.
