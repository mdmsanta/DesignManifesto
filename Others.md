## Design for Others

In this project, we were tasked with redesigning the Worcester Public Library for mobile, as well as for our target demographic of women aged 30-40 years old. This was the first project where we had to design something ourselves, rather than critiquing other designs. To begin, we created a mood board to set a general theme for us to follow while creating our prototype. This was an essential tool throughout this process, as it helped us remain consistent when using fonts and colors. I learned about different ways to make prototypes; we started with paper sketches and then eventually used Adobe XD and Invision to create testable prototypes. User testing proved to be very helpful throughout this process and allowed us to make changes that made the redesign more user friendly.
