## Design for Wellbeing

In Design for Wellbeing we used Affectiva libraries to gage users' emotions, and based on that tell users something about themselves. My group chose to tell users if they were a cat person or a dog person. From there we also told users the benefits of becoming a pet owner and how it could benefit their health, for example. To do this we checked the value for joy when the user looked at a picture of a cat and of a dog, and repeated this multiple times.
