## Design Manifesto

Throughout the course of this term I learned about the design process, but not only that implemented it many times while working on the various projects assigned. I learned that while there are a set of steps to follow, what you do within those steps may change based on the project and its goals; the base is the same but the process may be slightly different. For example, in some cases Wizard-of-Oz testing may be the best way to test a prototype, but in other cases it may not be. By going through the design process for each of our six projects, I was able to refine my design process each time. By the end of the term this is what I have come up with:

-Design with Purpose: Come up with a meaningful and useful idea
-Consider how to implement this idea: sketch and prototype
-User testing, user testing, and more user testing
-Revise
-Reflection for future models

1. Design with Purpose
Each design sprint this term had a different purpose. Our first project, Good Design, Bad Design, had the broad topic of identifying an example of good design and bad design on our campus. This initial project was used to introduce us to design concepts and get us thinking about different aspects of design. This proved useful because these concepts were then applied in future projects. The rest of the projects we completed had more of a purpose in terms of how to benefit a group of users. In my opinion this is one of the most important parts of the design process, if not the most important. If your product has no purpose, then why make it? In my everyday life, I take value in doing things for a purpose; it is the reason I want to pursue computer science. I want to create programs that will benefit others and make their life a little easier. Part of doing this means thinking carefully about the design process. 
Each project we completed this term made us think about why we were creating that project, whether we were designing for others, understanding, wellbeing, or something else, the overarching goal was to create a product that would benefit a user in some way. Before starting each project, I would think to myself “Why am I doing this? How will this ultimately benefit someone?”. This purpose is the guiding beacon of the project, because without you would not have anything to create. 
Design for Wellbeing is a perfect example of this because the entire point of the project was to design something that would somehow improve a user’s life and tell them something new about themselves. We considered a few different ideas, but ultimately decided to use Affectiva to determine if the user was a cat or a dog person. While a simple idea, we took it further than just stating they were a cat or dog person, and also included the benefits, such as improving mental health, of having said pet. We chose to do this because, even though it may seem like an inconsequential idea initially, it can help someone realize the benefits of having a pet, besides the fact that they think they are cute. 
The first step to creating an impactful project is determining its purpose, because without that then you are designing with no guide and it will likely not turn out as well.

2. Implementation: Sketch and Prototype
Once you have a solid idea and purpose, another important aspect of the design process is sketching and prototyping. This allows you to see problems users may encounter early on. Sketching on paper is a quick and easy way to see your ideas and get them down. From there more sophisticated prototypes can be made, but the sketches are very helpful as a base for future models.
In Design for Others, we redesigned the Worcester Public Library’s website for mobile and for our specified demographic of women aged 30–40. Sketching was particularly helpful in this project because we could quickly draw different ideas for how we wanted to change the pages. In some cases, we could immediately see where our designs were not going to work, and in other cases, it allowed us to see where improvements could be made. 
Once we were satisfied with the sketches, we began designing on Adobe XD and then on Invision. It is more time consuming to design the pages using Adobe XD and Invision, so the initial designs on the sketches helped guide us for these prototypes. The next step from here is testing these designs on users to further see how we can improve our designs.

3. User Testing, User Testing, and More User Testing
One of the most important lessons I learned from this class was to always test your prototypes on users. User testing is one of the most valuable tools we have. Ultimately, these are the people you are designing the product for, the people that will actually be using it. It is extremely valuable to perform user testing throughout the design process, and to start early. It enables larger problems to be found early on when it is not as difficult to change. 
When designing the script for our chatbot in Design for Tension, we used Wizard of Oz testing before coding our bot. By doing this we were able to find out where users got stuck or where the bot was unable to answer their questions. For example, from this testing we found out that when a user said “hello, what is your name” at any point in the conversation the bot would start the discussion over and ask the user for their name again. We may not have discovered this loophole as early on if we had not begun the user testing process so early. 

4. Revise
After using testing, it is important to revise and revisit. Think about the feedback from testing and then come up with ways to solve the issues users were having. This was something we did in each project this term. Revision leads to improved products and overall a better user experience. 
After receiving feedback, I would look back at the original thought process we had when designing that feature and from there consider what the users said. It is important to take into account both of these and from there make changes. Another important thing I learned from this class is that users do not always know what they want, even when they think they do. It is important to look deeper into their feedback and find what they truly want, because it is not always on the surface.

5. Reflect
After going through the above steps, and going through some of them multiple times, it is then important to reflect on what you have done. After each project I would look back at what we did and consider ways to make it better. What would I want to change in future models? Since most of these design sprints were about a week, what would I want to add if I had more time? This reflection also allows me to see what I did well in each project, and what aspects should also be incorporated in future projects. Furthermore, it allows me to then see what did not go as well, and then how to fix it for further projects. Each project is a learning experience, and through reflection, can lead to each project getting better each time as the design process is refined.

Before taking this class I had not been taught a lot about design techniques and the design process itself. I was able to learn a lot about this over the course of the term, and what I learned I will be able to implement in my future projects I work on. I was able to learn the steps of the design process and adjust them more to what I thought was most valuable and helped me achieve my goals. The skills I gained from this course are going to be extremely valuable for me in future projects.
